# CS4533_Parallel_And_Concurrent_Computing
Here I get hands on experience with lecture material. 

## To run Lab 1 and to get different execution time
```bash
./Lab_1/linkedlistserial n m mMember mInsert mDelete
n = number of inital items in the linked list
m = number of total Member, Insert and Delete operation
mMember, mInsert, mDelete = fractions of each operations
e.g. -: ./Lab_1/linkedlistserial 1000 10000 0.50 0.25 0.25
